# Python Hangman #

----------
The Hangman word-guessing game hits a nice sweet spot when learning a new computer language. Not as trivial as "Hello World" but not overly difficult to implement.

This version of Hangman was written utilizing the [Python](https://www.python.org/ "https://www.python.org/") language. Originally, this was a Python 2.7 program but now utilizes Python 3.5.

To launch Hangman, use this command:

    python3.exe hangman.py

To run a graphical version of Hangman, invoke the following command:

    python3.exe hangman_gr.py

## Acknowlegement ##

The graphical version of Hangman utilizes the ```graphics.py``` library by John Zelle.  This file and its documentation are available at Zelle's [Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science](http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/ "http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/") web page.
